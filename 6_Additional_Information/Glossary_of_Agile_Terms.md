# Scrum Glossary

This glossary provides definitions and explanations for key terms used in the Scrum framework. Scrum is an Agile methodology for managing and delivering projects, especially in software development.

## A

**Agile**: A set of principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams.

**Artifact**: A tangible by-product produced during the development process. In Scrum, the primary artifacts are the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment.

## B

**Backlog Refinement**: The ongoing process of reviewing and adjusting the Product Backlog, where the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items.

**Burn-down Chart**: A visual representation of the remaining work in a Sprint Backlog. It shows the progress of work over time, helping the team track the completion of tasks.

**Burn-up Chart**: A visual representation of the work completed toward the release of a product. It shows progress over time and is useful for tracking overall project completion.

## C

**Cross-functional Team**: A team composed of members with various functional expertise working toward a common goal. In Scrum, the Development Team is cross-functional.

**Daily Scrum**: A 15-minute time-boxed event held each day for the Development Team. The team reviews progress toward the Sprint Goal and plans the next 24 hours.

**Definition of Done**: A shared understanding of what it means for work to be considered complete. This ensures transparency and quality.

**Development Team**: The group of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.

## E

**Empiricism**: The process of making decisions based on what is known. In Scrum, this means working in a transparent, inspectable, and adaptable manner.

**Epic**: A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or stories. Epics span multiple sprints and help organize and prioritize work at a high level.

**Estimate**: An approximate calculation of the effort or time needed to complete a Product Backlog item or task. Estimates are usually made using story points or time units.

## F

**Forecast**: The Development Team's projected amount of work that can be completed during a Sprint.

**Framework**: A basic structure underlying a system, concept, or text. In Scrum, the framework refers to the rules, roles, events, and artifacts that define the methodology.

## I

**Increment**: The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. It must be in usable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.

**Invest (INVEST criteria)**: A mnemonic for user story quality criteria. It stands for Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.

## P

**Product Backlog**: An ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.

**Product Increment**: The version of the product that is available at the end of a Sprint. It includes the new functionality added during the Sprint.

**Product Owner**: The person responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. They manage the Product Backlog.

**Product Vision**: A short, high-level statement or visualization of the desired future state that the product is intended to achieve.

## S

**Scrum Master**: The person responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. They do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.

**Scrum Team**: A self-organizing team consisting of a Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team. They work together to deliver increments of value.

**Sprint**: A time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

**Sprint Planning**: An event in Scrum that kicks off the Sprint. The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at this meeting.

**Sprint Retrospective**: An event held after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. It is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

**Sprint Review**: An event held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.

**Stakeholder**: A person with an interest in the outcome of the product. They are typically the customers, users, or sponsors.

**Story Points**: A unit of measure for expressing the overall size of a user story or feature in Scrum. It helps in estimating the effort required to implement a story.

## T

**Task**: A single unit of work that contributes to the completion of a Product Backlog item. Tasks are often broken down into smaller units.

**Team Velocity**: The amount of work a Scrum Team can tackle during a single Sprint, measured in story points. It helps in planning and forecasting future Sprints.

**Time-box**: A fixed period of time during which an event or activity takes place. All Scrum events are time-boxed.

## U

**User Story**: A brief statement of intent that describes something the system needs to do for a user. It is usually written in the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]."

## V

**Velocity**: A measure of the amount of work a Development Team can tackle during a single Sprint. It is the key metric in Scrum to help with Sprint planning.

**Vision**: The long-term goal of the project. It provides direction and purpose.

## W

**Work In Progress (WIP)**: The amount of work that the team has started but not yet completed. Limiting WIP is a key principle in Scrum to improve flow and reduce bottlenecks.
