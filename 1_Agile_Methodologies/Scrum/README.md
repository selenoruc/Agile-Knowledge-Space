# Introduction to Scrum

Scrum is an Agile framework designed to help teams develop, deliver, and sustain complex products effectively. Originally proposed by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber in the early 1990s, Scrum has since gained widespread adoption across various industries beyond software development, including marketing, education, and healthcare.

## Key Principles of Scrum

At its core, Scrum is guided by 3 key principles.These principles form the foundation of Scrum, guiding the team in its pursuit of agility, efficiency, and excellence in product development.

- **Transparency:** Scrum emphasizes transparency in all aspects of the project. This means that all information relevant to the project should be visible and accessible to the entire Scrum Team. Transparency fosters trust and informed decision-making, enabling the team to work more effectively towards achieving its goals.

- **Inspection:** Inspection is a fundamental aspect of Scrum, involving frequent and regular reviews of the product, processes, and progress. Inspection provides valuable feedback loops that enable continuous improvement and ensure that the product meets stakeholders' expectations.

- **Adaptation:** Scrum embraces adaptability as a core principle, recognizing that change is inevitable in complex projects. Scrum encourages continuous adaptation through iterative development and regular retrospectives, allowing the team to optimize its approach and deliver greater value with each iteration.
