# Introduction to Scrum Practices

Scrum, an Agile framework for project management, is characterized by its iterative and incremental approach to product development. Central to Scrum are a set of practices designed to facilitate effective collaboration, continuous improvement, and the delivery of high-quality products. These practices guide Scrum Teams in planning, executing, and reviewing their work throughout each Sprint, ensuring transparency, adaptability, and value delivery.

**Sprint Planning:** A collaborative session at the start of each Sprint where the Scrum Team defines the Sprint Goal and selects backlog items to work on. This session sets the direction for the Sprint and ensures alignment of efforts towards achieving the Sprint Goal. |  ![image](https://github.com/selenoruc/Agile-Knowledge-Space/assets/38296070/5a97792b-a6b5-4a79-82c9-633c6f5d5b94)

The Daily Scrum promotes transparency, communication, and quick decision-making within the team.
**Sprint Review:** A collaborative meeting held at the end of each Sprint where the Scrum Team presents the completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback. The Sprint Review provides an opportunity for stakeholders to inspect the product increment and make adjustments to the Product Backlog based on new insights.  |  ![](https://files.sitebuilder.webafrica.co.za/64/24/6424676f-cc0e-4654-b08f-b11cd3afa039.PNG)

- **Sprint Review:** A collaborative meeting held at the end of each Sprint where the Scrum Team presents the completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback. The Sprint Review provides an opportunity for stakeholders to inspect the product increment and make adjustments to the Product Backlog based on new insights.

- **Sprint Retrospective:** A reflective meeting held at the end of each Sprint where the Scrum Team reflects on their processes and identifies opportunities for improvement. The Sprint Retrospective fosters a culture of continuous improvement and learning within the team.

- **Backlog Refinement (Grooming):** An ongoing activity where the Scrum Team collaborates to review and refine the items in the Product Backlog. This ensures that backlog items are well-understood, actionable, and ready for selection in upcoming Sprints.

- **Product Backlog Refinement:** Regularly reviewing and updating the Product Backlog to ensure it reflects the latest priorities, changes, and insights. This practice helps keep the backlog manageable, prioritized, and aligned with the product vision and goals.

- **Definition of Done (DoD):** Establishing clear and agreed-upon criteria that must be met for a backlog item to be considered "done" and potentially shippable. The Definition of Done ensures consistency, quality, and completeness in the product increment delivered at the end of each Sprint.

- **Scrum of Scrums:** Coordination mechanism used when multiple Scrum Teams are working on the same product or project. Representatives from each team meet regularly to discuss progress, dependencies, and any cross-team impediments.

- **Burn-down Charts:** Visual representation of remaining work over time, typically used to track progress within a Sprint or towards achieving project milestones. Burn-down charts provide transparency and help the team monitor progress and identify potential issues.

- **Task Boards:** Visual display of tasks or user stories, typically organized into columns representing different stages of progress (e.g., to-do, in progress, done). Task boards provide visibility into work status and promote collaboration and alignment within the team.

These Scrum practices, when implemented effectively, enable Scrum Teams to deliver valuable products iteratively, respond to change quickly, and continuously enhance their processes and outcomes. By embracing these practices, organizations can realize the benefits of Agile development and thrive in today's dynamic business environment.
