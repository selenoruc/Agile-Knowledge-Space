## Case Study 1: Scrum Reboot This Time With The Values
In their initial endeavor to achieve agility, Intralinks initially adopted a well-intentioned yet somewhat rigid implementation of Scrum, executed with earnest effort and diligence. 
However, they fell short of their objective to enhance agility. 
Subsequently, they embarked on a "Scrum Reboot" initiative and achieved success by integrating the core concept of inspection and adaptation, along with embracing the Scrum Values of 
Courage, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Commitment. These values cultivated the cultural milieu essential for achieving success. 
Intralinks brought the Scrum Values to life by prioritizing six guiding principles:

- Self-organization
- Done means done
- Empowered Product Owners
- Servant-leader Scrum Masters
- Scrum Team ownership for adaption
- The delivery of business value

**Note:** This case study uses the term Development Team. Based on the changes to the Scrum Guide in 2020, this is now referred to as Developer, however the context of this case study does not change.
