# The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a foundational document that outlines the values and principles of Agile software development. It was created by a group of software developers in 2001 as a reaction to traditional, plan-driven approaches to software development.

## Values

The Agile Manifesto emphasizes four key values:

1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**: Agile prioritizes the importance of people and their interactions within the development team and with stakeholders over relying solely on processes and tools.

2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation**: Agile values delivering a working product to customers over extensive documentation. While documentation is important, the primary measure of progress is the working software.

3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**: Agile encourages active involvement and collaboration with customers throughout the development process, rather than relying on fixed contracts and negotiations.

4. **Responding to change over following a plan**: Agile embraces change and acknowledges that requirements will evolve over time. It values the ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in customer needs and market dynamics.

## Principles

The Agile Manifesto is supported by 12 principles that guide Agile software development:

1. **Customer satisfaction** by delivering valuable software frequently, with emphasis on the shorter timescale.
2. **Welcome changing** requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. **Deliver** working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together **daily** throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the **environment and support** they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and **good design** enhances agility.
10. Simplicity **-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-** is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
12. At regular intervals, the team **reflects** on how to become more effective, then tunes and **adjusts** its behavior accordingly.

The Agile Manifesto has had a profound impact on the software development industry, promoting iterative and incremental approaches to product development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change.
