## Using Jira for Scrum

### Scrum Methodology Overview
Scrum delivers work in fixed-length sprints focusing on teamwork and iterative progress.

### Key Scrum Components

2. **Manage the Backlog**: Create and prioritize issues.
3. **Plan Sprints**: Move issues to the sprint and start it.
4. **During the Sprint**: Use the Scrum Board to track progress.
5. **End the Sprint**: Review and conduct retrospectives.

Kanban focuses on continuous delivery and limiting work in progress.

### Key Kanban Components
- **Kanban Board**: Visual tool for workflow management.
- **WIP Limits**: Constraints on ongoing work.
- **Continuous Flow**: Continuous task completion without fixed-length iterations.

### Setting Up a Kanban Project
1. **Create a Project**: Select "Kanban" as the project type.
2. **Manage the Kanban Board**: Customize columns and set WIP limits.
3. **Add Issues to the Board**: Create and move issues across columns.
4. **Workflow Management**: Monitor and adjust workflow.
5. **Review and Improve**: Use reports and retrospectives for continuous improvement.

## Tracking Progress

- **Burndown Chart** (Scrum): Shows remaining work in the sprint.

- **Control Chart** (Kanban): Shows task cycle times.
- **Cumulative Flow Diagram** (Kanban): Visualizes workflow.
